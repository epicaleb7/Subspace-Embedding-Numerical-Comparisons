# SubspaceEmbeddingNumericalComparisons
 Code to generate, plot, and thereby compare different subspace embeddings

## Brief description:
There are two files: 'Generate' and 'Plot'.
* You should run the Generate file followed by the Plot file separately. However, especially if you update any of the parameters, you must make sure you update the corresponding parameters in both files. Otherwise the CSV reading will not work, and the code will alert you of this.
* A more detailed description of each file is contained within markdown boxes in each notebook.
* It should be possible to simply press 'Run all' and have all the code run immediately, in order, with no modifications.

Keep note:
* in order for this code to run fully, you will need folders called `CSVs/` and `Plots/` in the local directory. 
* Generation code can take quite some time, on the order of tens of minutes. Prepare a snack while you wait.
